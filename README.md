ü§ñ Artha-Mitra: AI Stock Valuation Expert

‚ú® AI-Powered Financial Intelligence, Right in Your Browser

Artha-Mitra is a comprehensive Chrome Extension that transforms raw stock data and company news into actionable investment intelligence using Chrome's built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano) and external cloud APIs. It drastically reduces the time needed for investment research by synthesizing complex analysis‚ÄîDCF valuations, leadership summaries, and tailored trading strategies‚Äîinto a simple, on-demand popup.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Installation for Judges)

This extension requires a version of Chrome (e.g., Canary) that supports the chrome.ai namespace.

IMPORTANT: This extension now uses the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API for real-time financial data. You will need a free API key from their website to run the DCF valuation.

Get your FMP API Key:

Visit the FMP website and sign up for a free plan to get your API key.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/kaug101/artha-mitra.git](https://github.com/kaug101/artha-mitra.git)
cd artha-mitra


Enable Developer Mode in Chrome:

Open Chrome.

Navigate to chrome://extensions/.

Toggle "Developer mode" on (usually in the top right corner).

Load the Extension:

Click the "Load unpacked" button.

Select the entire artha-mitra/ folder.

Pin the Extension & Configure Keys:

Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) next to the address bar.

Click the pin icon next to "Artha-Mitra" to make it easily accessible.

Click the Artha-Mitra icon to open the popup.

Click the cloud icon in the top-right.

Enter your FMP API Key and click "Save FMP Key". The status should turn green.

(Optional) Enter your Gemini Cloud API Key for more advanced AI analysis.

üß™ Testing and Demo Guide

The following steps cover all the key features and demonstrate the use of the required AI APIs:
