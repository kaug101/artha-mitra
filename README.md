# ü§ñ Artha-Mitra: AI Stock Valuation Expert

## ‚ú® AI-Powered Financial Intelligence, Right in Your Browser

Artha-Mitra is a comprehensive Chrome Extension that transforms raw stock data and company news into actionable investment intelligence using **Chrome's built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano)**. It drastically reduces the time needed for investment research by synthesizing complex analysis‚ÄîDCF targets, leadership summaries, and tailored trading strategies‚Äîinto a simple, on-demand popup.

## üèÜ Hackathon Compliance: Use of Chrome Built-in AI

This project directly leverages the Chrome AI APIs to deliver on its core features, ensuring efficient, on-device (client-side) processing powered by **Gemini Nano**.

| Artha-Mitra Feature | Chrome AI API Used | Purpose of AI Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy Recommendations** | **Prompt API** (`chrome.ai.prompt`) | Generates a concise, 3-point trading strategy (Timing, Risk, Allocation) tailored to the stock's type and the current macroeconomic environment. |
| **Bullish/Bearish Scenarios** | **Prompt API** (`chrome.ai.prompt`) | Creates a persuasive, two-paragraph bull case scenario, synthesizing financial data into a compelling narrative, demonstrating creative content generation. |
| **Leadership Analysis** | **Summarizer API** (`chrome.ai.summarizer`) | Analyzes mock CEO commentary (simulating earnings call transcripts) and distills the core strategic points into a bulleted list for rapid consumption. |
| **Global News Coverage Insight**| **Prompt API** (`chrome.ai.prompt`) | Takes a news headline and snippet and generates an instant, structured JSON output detailing "Why It‚Äôs Happening" and "What Investors Should Do." |

## üöÄ Key Features

  * **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Targets:** Provides price targets for 3, 6, and 12 months (Mock Data).
  * **AI-Driven Analysis:** Instantly generates a leadership summary and actionable strategy recommendations using **Gemini Nano**.
  * **Real-time Quick Reply Prompts:** Interactive buttons for immediate next steps.
  * **Re-check Numbers (Level II Mock):** Demonstrates use of a Content Script to inject into a webpage and gather dynamic, live data (Level II mock for architecture demo).

## üß™ Testing and Demo Guide

The following steps cover all the key features and demonstrate the use of the required AI APIs:

| Step | Action | Expected AI Output & API Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Run Valuation** | Click the Artha-Mitra icon, enter a sample ticker (e.g., `AAPL`), and click **"Analyze Stock üìà"**. | Displays immediate results (Current Price, DCF Targets). |
| **2. Trigger AI Analysis**| Click the **"Show Background & AI Analysis"** button in the results section. | **Gemini Nano** runs (via $\text{background.js}$). The details section populates with: \<ul\>\<li\>**Leadership Analysis (Summarizer API):** Bulleted summary of key strategic points.\</li\>\<li\>**Strategy & Scenario (Prompt API):** A concise 3-point strategy and a persuasive bullish narrative.\</li\>\</ul\>|
| **3. Test Content Script**| Click the **"Re-check Numbers (L2 Data)"** button at the bottom of the details section. | A confirmation alert is displayed. Check the Chrome console for the extension's **Service Worker** to see the message passing and the mock live data response from the $\text{content.js}$ script. |
| **4. Check News Analysis**| Open the **Service Worker console** (via `chrome://extensions/`). The script attempts to run a news analysis function upon load (uncommented in `popup.js`). | The console will show the structured JSON output from the **Prompt API** for the mocked news item, including "why" the news is happening and "what investors should do." |
| **5. Test Feedback Loop**| Click the **"No"** quick reply button. | A simulated browser alert confirms the link to the feedback form (`https://forms.gle/...`). |
